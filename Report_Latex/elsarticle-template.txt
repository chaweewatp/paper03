This paper proposed a novel electricity price forecasting method based on a novel Residual Neural Network (ResNet) for probabilistic electricity price forecasting under spike price environment.
The modern electricity price became more fluctuated and generally unanticipated spike price.
The use of prediction interval or probabilistic forecasting was interested due to it help market participants to submit effective bids with low risks.
A proposed new model was developed from ResNet approach which it capable of spike price and interval price value prediction.
The proposed ResNet was consisting of two network layers.
First neural network layers was spike prediction part.
The output of second neural network layers is formulated to interval price forecasting by lower and upper bound estimation (LUBE).
The LUBE in this study includes quantile regression (QR) and mean and variance (MV) estimation.
The proposed forecasting models was demonstrated with GEFCom2014 dataset.
The dataset is consisting of 15 tasks for electricity price forecasting where high and spike price are included.
The results were compared with benchmarks as provided by GEFCom2014, Quantile Regression Average (QRA) and multilayer perceptron network (MLP) approaches.
The performances of forecasting models were evaluated in term of accuracy and reliablity metrics by Pinball Loss Function and Coverage Width-based Criterion (CWC), respectively.
The significant outcome of this paper was that forecasting model, ResNet, cooperated with spike price prediction imporved the forecasting's performance in term of accuracy and reliability aspects.
Moreover, increasing in confidence level of ResNet models could generates lower CWC values and represent high reliability's satification.
