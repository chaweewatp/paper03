abstract = {This paper proposes a generic framework for probabilistic energy forecasting, and discusses the application of the method to several tracks in the 2014 Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom2014). The proposed method uses a multiple quantile regression approach to predict a full distribution over possible future energy outcomes, uses the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the optimization problems resulting from this quantile regression formulation efficiently, and uses a radial basis function network to capture the non-linear dependencies on the input data. For the GEFCom2014 competition, the approach proved general enough to obtain one of the top five ranks in three tracks, solar, wind, and price forecasting, and it was also ranked seventh in the final load forecasting track.},
