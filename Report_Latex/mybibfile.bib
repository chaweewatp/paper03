abstract = {A variety of methods and ideas have been tried for electricity price forecasting (EPF) over the last 15 years, with varying degrees of success. This review article aims to explain the complexity of available solutions, their strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities and threats that the forecasting tools offer or that may be encountered. The paper also looks ahead and speculates on the directions EPF will or should take in the next decade or so. In particular, it postulates the need for objective comparative EPF studies involving (i) the same datasets, (ii) the same robust error evaluation procedures, and (iii) statistical testing of the significance of one model's outperformance of another.},

@article{Hong2016,
abstract = {The energy industry has been going through a significant modernization process over the last decade. Its infrastructure is being upgraded rapidly. The supply, demand and prices are becoming more volatile and less predictable than ever before. Even its business model is being challenged fundamentally. In this competitive and dynamic environment, many decision-making processes rely on probabilistic forecasts to quantify the uncertain future. Although most of the papers in the energy forecasting literature focus on point or single-valued forecasts, the research interest in probabilistic energy forecasting research has taken off rapidly in recent years. In this paper, we summarize the recent research progress on probabilistic energy forecasting. A major portion of the paper is devoted to introducing the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom2014), a probabilistic energy forecasting competition with four tracks on load, price, wind and solar forecasting, which attracted 581 participants from 61 countries. We conclude the paper with 12 predictions for the next decade of energy forecasting.},

@article{Dudek2016,
abstract = {This paper proposes a forecasting approach based on a feedforward neural network for probabilistic electricity price forecasting for GEFCom2014. The approach does not require any special data preprocessing, such as detrending, deseasonality or decomposition of the time series. The input variables, zonal and system loads are processed nonlinearly by the multilayer perceptron in order to obtain point forecasts. The model is trained on the most recent period of data. This allows us to take into account the current trends, conditions and variability of the processes, as well as to simplify the model. Probabilistic forecasts are then generated from the point forecasts and the error distribution on the training set in the form of quantiles.},

@article{Maciejowska2016,
abstract = {This paper provides detailed information on Team Poland's winning methodology in the electricity price forecasting track of GEFCom2014. A new hybrid model extending the Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) approach of Nowotarski and Weron (2015) is proposed. It consists of four major blocks: point forecasting, pre-filtering, quantile regression modeling and post-processing. This universal model structure enables a single block to be developed independently, without the performances of the remaining blocks being affected. The four-block model design is complemented by the inclusion of expert judgement, which may be of great importance in periods of unusually high or low electricity demand.},

@article{Juban2016,
abstract = {This paper proposes a generic framework for probabilistic energy forecasting, and discusses the application of the method to several tracks in the 2014 Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom2014). The proposed method uses a multiple quantile regression approach to predict a full distribution over possible future energy outcomes, uses the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the optimization problems resulting from this quantile regression formulation efficiently, and uses a radial basis function network to capture the non-linear dependencies on the input data. For the GEFCom2014 competition, the approach proved general enough to obtain one of the top five ranks in three tracks, solar, wind, and price forecasting, and it was also ranked seventh in the final load forecasting track.},
